# Touch
Touch is a social networking app that allows users to message randomly suggested contacts. Once the Compose wheel is spun, users can choose to message that randomly selected contact with a custom emoji or to spin again. In the inbox, a user can view and thank Touch messages that they have received. In a nutshell, the app allows users to keep in touch at the touch of a finger.

Touch uses a cell-phone verification system for login.
